            "['### Enhanced Prompt: Remote Team Task Management MVP  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Project Title**  \\nCollabTask MVP  \\n\\n#### **Project Description**  \\nA lightweight, real-time task management application designed for remote teams to assign, track, and collaborate on tasks. The MVP will focus on core functionality with minimal UI complexity, enabling teams to hit the ground running.  \\n\\n#### **Tech Stack**  \\n- **Frontend**: React (with TypeScript) + Vite  \\n  *Reason*: Fast development, component reusability, and strong ecosystem for MVP.  \\n- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  \\n  *Reason*: Lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate with frontend.  \\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL  \\n  *Reason*: ACID compliance for reliable task data, free tier for MVP.  \\n- **Real-Time**: Socket.IO  \\n  *Reason*: Enables instant task updates without full page reloads.  \\n- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  \\n  *Reason*: Stateless, secure, and easy to implement for MVP.  \\n- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Heroku (backend)  \\n  *Reason*: Free tiers, quick setup, and seamless integration.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Features (MVP Priorities)**  \\n1. **High Priority**  \\n   - User authentication (signup/login)  \\n   - Create, edit, delete tasks  \\n   - Assign tasks to team members  \\n   - Real-time task status updates  \\n   - Basic task filtering (by assignee, status)  \\n\\n2. **Medium Priority**  \\n   - Comment threads on tasks  \\n   - Task due dates  \\n   - User profile management  \\n\\n3. **Low Priority**  \\n   - File attachments  \\n   - Task analytics (e.g., completion rates)  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **User Stories**  \\n1. **As a team member**, I want to create tasks with titles, descriptions, and assignees so I can organize work.  \\n2. **As a project manager**, I want to assign tasks to team members and track their status in real-time to monitor progress.  \\n3. **As a user**, I want to receive instant notifications when tasks are assigned or updated to stay informed.  \\n4. **As a team member**, I want to comment on tasks to collaborate without switching tools.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Acceptance Criteria**  \\n1. **Task Creation**  \\n   - Given authenticated access, a user can create a task with a title, description, and assignee.  \\n   - Tasks appear in the assignee’s task list in real-time.  \\n   - Validation: Title and assignee are required fields.  \\n\\n2. **Real-Time Updates**  \\n   - When a task status is updated (e.g., \"In Progress\" → \"Done\"), all connected users see the change instantly.  \\n   - No manual page refresh required.  \\n\\n3. **Authentication**  \\n   - Users can sign up/login with email/password.  \\n   - JWT tokens expire after 24 hours.  \\n   - Protected routes return 401 for unauthenticated requests.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Database Schema**  \\n```sql\\n-- Users Table\\nCREATE TABLE users (\\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,\\n  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\\n  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL\\n);\\n\\n-- Tasks Table\\nCREATE TABLE tasks (\\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\\n  description TEXT,\\n  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT \\'todo\\', -- e.g., \\'todo\\', \\'in_progress\\', \\'done\\'\\n  assignee_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),\\n  created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),\\n  due_date TIMESTAMP,\\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\\n);\\n\\n-- Comments Table\\nCREATE TABLE comments (\\n  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n  task_id INTEGER REFERENCES tasks(id),\\n  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),\\n  content TEXT NOT NULL,\\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()\\n);\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **API Endpoints**  \\n| Method | Endpoint               | Description                          |  \\n|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|  \\n| POST   | `/api/auth/signup`     | User registration                    |  \\n| POST   | `/api/auth/login`      | User login (returns JWT)             |  \\n| GET    | `/api/tasks`           | Fetch all tasks (with filters)       |  \\n| POST   | `/api/tasks`           | Create a new task                    |  \\n| PUT    | `/api/tasks/:id`       | Update task details/status           |  \\n| DELETE | `/api/tasks/:id`       | Delete a task                        |  \\n| POST   | `/api/tasks/:id/comments` | Add a comment to a task            |  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Frontend Components**  \\n- `AuthPage`: Signup/login forms.  \\n- `Dashboard`: Task list with filters (assignee, status).  \\n- `TaskModal`: Form for creating/editing tasks.  \\n- `TaskCard`: Displays task details, status, and comments.  \\n- `CommentSection`: Real-time comment feed.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Deployment Instructions**  \\n1. **Frontend**:  \\n   - Build with `npm run build` and deploy to Vercel.  \\n   - Set environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to backend URL.  \\n2. **Backend**:  \\n   - Deploy to Heroku.  \\n   - Configure environment variables: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`.  \\n3. **Database**:  \\n   - Use Heroku Postgres add-on or free tier of ElephantSQL.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Testing Strategy**  \\n- **Unit Tests**: Jest for React components and Node.js utilities.  \\n- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API endpoints.  \\n- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for critical flows (e.g., login → create task).  \\n- **Coverage**: Aim for 80% test coverage.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Project Timeline (MVP)**  \\n- **Week 1**: Setup (repo, tech stack, database schema).  \\n- **Week 2**: Authentication, task CRUD APIs.  \\n- **Week 3**: Frontend components, real-time updates (Socket.IO).  \\n- **Week 4**: Comments, filtering, testing, and deployment.  \\n\\n--- \\n\\n**Final Output**: A functional, deployable MVP with core task management features. Focus on simplicity, real-time collaboration, and scalability for future enhancements.']\n",
