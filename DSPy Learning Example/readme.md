## Test 1: Question Answering

### Question
**What is the capital of Japan?**

### Processing
```
üîç Testing QA: What is the capital of Japan?
100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 3/3 [00:00<00:00, 19.76it/s]
2025-10-14 06:04:46,323 - __main__ - INFO - Using 2 examples for DSPy optimization
Bootstrapped 3 full traces after 2 examples for up to 1 rounds, amounting to 3 attempts.
```

### Answer
```python
Prediction(
    reasoning="The capital of Japan is Tokyo. Tokyo has been the capital of Japan since 1868, when the imperial residence was moved from Kyoto to Edo (which was then renamed Tokyo). Tokyo is the largest city in Japan and serves as the country's political, economic, and cultural center.",
    answer='Tokyo'
)
```

**Result:** Tokyo

## Test 2: Text Summarization

### Processing
```
üìù Testing Summarization:
100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 2/2 [00:00<00:00, 317.41it/s]
Bootstrapped 2 full traces after 1 examples for up to 1 rounds, amounting to 2 attempts.
```

### Summary Output
```python
Prediction(
    reasoning="The text discusses the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on daily life and work. It provides specific examples of AI applications (self-driving cars, virtual assistants) and notes the increasing integration of AI into everyday experiences. I will summarize these key points concisely while maintaining the core message about AI's growing influence.",
    summary='Artificial intelligence is transforming daily life and work through applications like self-driving cars and virtual assistants, with increasing integration into everyday experiences.'
)
```

**Summary:** Artificial intelligence is transforming daily life and work through applications like self-driving cars and virtual assistants, with increasing integration into everyday experiences.

## Explanation

### Step 1: Initialization Phase
The script started by initializing an OpenRouter LLM (Language Model):
- **Model:** z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free (a free tier model)
- **Temperature:** 0.7 (controls randomness - higher = more creative, lower = more focused)

### Step 2: DSPy Setup
DSPy is a framework for programming with language models:
- Created a Question-Answering (QA) chain with optimization
- Successfully configured DSPy to work with the OpenRouter model

### Step 3: Summarization Chain Setup
- Created a text summarization chain also with DSPy optimization
- This chain is used to create concise summaries of longer texts

### Step 4: Testing Phase
The script began its testing phase:
- All components were successfully initialized and ready for testing

### Step 5: QA Test Execution
**What happened:**
- Asked: "What is the capital of Japan?"
- The system used 3 examples for few-shot learning
- DSPy "bootstrapped" 3 full traces (tried 3 different approaches)
- The model correctly answered "Tokyo" with detailed reasoning

### Step 6: Summarization Test Execution
**What happened:**
- The system was given a text about AI transforming daily life
- It used 2 examples for few-shot learning
- DSPy tried 2 different approaches to create the best summary
- The result was a concise summary that captured the main points

### Final Result
- ‚úÖ All tests passed successfully
- ‚úÖ The DSPy-LangChain integration is working properly
- ‚úÖ Both QA and summarization functions are operational

---

## Summary
The script successfully tested a smart AI system that can answer questions and summarize text. It used a technique called "few-shot learning" where it learned from examples to improve its performance, and it worked perfectly for both question answering and text summarization tasks.
