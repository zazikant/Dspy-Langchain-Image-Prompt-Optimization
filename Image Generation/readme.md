# DSPy Prompt Generation Explanation

Keep temperature 0.7 . Else keep 0.3 when you want detailed prompt without much creativity. The only part that wasn't working was the `BootstrapFewShot` teleprompter, but the core DSPy functionality for prompt generation is fully implemented and working, as evidenced by the successful prompt generation outputs in the test runs. So the learning from examples provided doesnt work.

The final prompt is reloaded from cache when you try to run again with same input. 

This code uses DSPy to generate prompts. Here's how:

## DSPy Signatures

The code defines two DSPy signatures:

- `InitialPromptOptimization` for the first optimization step
- `PromptEnhancement` for enhancing the optimized prompt

## DSPy Modules

The code implements DSPy modules:

- `InitialPromptOptimizer` uses `dspy.Predict` with the initial optimization signature
- `PromptEnhancer` uses `dspy.Predict` with the enhancement signature
- `FullPromptOptimizer` combines these two modules in a pipeline

## DSPy LM Configuration

The code properly configures DSPy with the language model:

```python
lm = dspy.LM(
    model="openai/" + MODEL,
    api_key=API_KEY,
    temperature=TEMPERATURE,
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
)
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
```

## DSPy Example Usage

The code creates DSPy examples from the training data:

```python
return Example(
    taste=item['taste'],
    user_input=item['user_input'],
    optimized_prompt=item['optimized_prompt'],
    enhanced_prompt=item['enhanced_prompt']
).with_inputs('taste', 'user_input')
```

## DSPy Prediction Generation

The code uses DSPy to generate predictions:

```python
result = self.optimize(taste=taste, user_input=user_input)
```

## Summary

Yes, this code definitely uses DSPy to generate prompts. It leverages the DSPy framework with:

- Properly defined signatures
- Module-based architecture
- Language model integration
- Example-based training data

The only part that wasn't working was the `BootstrapFewShot` teleprompter, but the core DSPy functionality for prompt generation is fully implemented and working, as evidenced by the successful prompt generation outputs in the test runs.

# Quality Metric for DSPy Evaluation

The quality metric in this code is called `prompt_quality_metric()` and it evaluates how good the generated prompt is based on several criteria. Let me break it down:

## How the Quality Metric Works

The function calculates a score between 0 and 1 by checking these indicators:

1. **Details Check**: Looks for the word "detailed" in the prompt
2. **Style Check**: Checks for style-related terms like "style", "technique", or "aesthetic"
3. **Technical Check**: Looks for technical terms like "lighting", "focus", "texture", etc.
4. **Mood Check**: Searches for mood-related terms like "mood", "atmosphere", or "feeling"

Additionally, it has specific checks based on the artistic taste:

5. **Photography Terms** (for 'photorealistic' style): Checks for camera-specific terms like "aperture", "f/", "shutter", etc.
6. **Painting Terms** (for 'oil painting' style): Looks for painting-specific terms like "brushstroke", "impasto", "canvas", etc.

The final score is calculated by counting how many of these indicators are present and dividing by the total number of indicators.

## What Happens When You Add a New Taste

When you add a new taste (like "watercolor"), here's how the quality metric would be affected:

1. **General Indicators Still Apply**: The metric will still check for the general quality indicators (details, style, technical, mood), which is good because these apply to any artistic style.

2. **Missing Style-Specific Checks**: The current metric only has specific checks for 'photorealistic' and 'oil painting'. Your new taste won't have these specific checks, which might result in a lower quality score even if the prompt is good for that style.

3. **No Taste-Specific Evaluation**: The metric won't know if the prompt includes terms that are important for your new taste (like "wet-on-wet" for watercolor or "cel-shaded" for anime-style art).

## How to Improve the Metric for a New Taste

To properly evaluate a new taste, you should update the `prompt_quality_metric()` function:

```python
def prompt_quality_metric(example, pred, trace=None) -> float:
    """Calculate quality score for the final enhanced prompt."""
    prompt = pred.enhanced_prompt
    
    # General quality indicators
    has_details = 'detailed' in prompt.lower()
    has_style = any(style in prompt.lower() for style in ['style', 'technique', 'aesthetic'])
    has_technical = any(tech in prompt.lower() for tech in ['lighting', 'focus', 'texture', 'composition', 'resolution', 'aperture'])
    has_mood = any(mood in prompt.lower() for mood in ['mood', 'atmosphere', 'ambiance', 'feeling'])
    
    # Taste-specific checks
    has_photography_terms = True
    has_painting_terms = True
    has_watercolor_terms = True  # New for watercolor taste
    
    if example.taste == 'photorealistic':
        has_photography_terms = any(term in prompt.lower() for term in ['aperture', 'f/', 'shutter', 'depth', 'bokeh'])
    elif example.taste == 'oil painting':
        has_painting_terms = any(term in prompt.lower() for term in ['brushstroke', 'impasto', 'canvas', 'palette', 'texture'])
    elif example.taste == 'watercolor':  # New condition for watercolor
        has_watercolor_terms = any(term in prompt.lower() for term in ['wet-on-wet', 'washes', 'dry brush', 'transparency', 'flow'])
    
    # Calculate score
    indicators = [has_details, has_style, has_technical, has_mood, has_photography_terms, has_painting_terms, has_watercolor_terms]
    return sum(indicators) / len(indicators)
```

This way, when you add a new taste, you can also add specific checks that are relevant to that artistic style, ensuring the quality metric properly evaluates prompts in that style.

# Answering Your Questions

## How many tastes are mentioned?

In this code, there are **6** artistic tastes mentioned:
- photorealistic
- oil painting
- anime
- cyberpunk
- watercolor
- 3d render

You can find this list in the `validate_taste()` function, which checks if a user-provided taste is valid.

## How to add a new taste?

If you want to add a new artistic style (like "sketch" or "pop art"), here's what you need to do:

1. **Update the valid tastes list** in the `validate_taste()` function:
   ```python
   valid_tastes = ['photorealistic', 'oil painting', 'anime', 'cyberpunk', 'watercolor', '3d render', 'NEW_TASTE']
   ```

2. **Add training data** for your new taste in the `create_training_data()` function. The code needs examples to learn how to optimize prompts for each style.

3. **Update the quality metric** in the `prompt_quality_metric()` function if your new taste has specific technical terms that should be included.

That's it! Just add your new taste to these places, and the system will be able to work with it. The code will then validate user inputs against the updated list of tastes and generate appropriate prompts for your new style.
