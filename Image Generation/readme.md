# DSPy Prompt Generation Explanation

Keep temperature 0.7 . Else keep 0.3 when you want detailed prompt without much creativity. The only part that wasn't working was the `BootstrapFewShot` teleprompter, but the core DSPy functionality for prompt generation is fully implemented and working, as evidenced by the successful prompt generation outputs in the test runs. So the learning from examples provided doesnt work.

The final prompt is reloaded from cache when you try to run again with same input. 

This code uses DSPy to generate prompts. Here's how:

## DSPy Signatures

The code defines two DSPy signatures:

- `InitialPromptOptimization` for the first optimization step
- `PromptEnhancement` for enhancing the optimized prompt

## DSPy Modules

The code implements DSPy modules:

- `InitialPromptOptimizer` uses `dspy.Predict` with the initial optimization signature
- `PromptEnhancer` uses `dspy.Predict` with the enhancement signature
- `FullPromptOptimizer` combines these two modules in a pipeline

## DSPy LM Configuration

The code properly configures DSPy with the language model:

```python
lm = dspy.LM(
    model="openai/" + MODEL,
    api_key=API_KEY,
    temperature=TEMPERATURE,
    base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
)
dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
```

## DSPy Example Usage

The code creates DSPy examples from the training data:

```python
return Example(
    taste=item['taste'],
    user_input=item['user_input'],
    optimized_prompt=item['optimized_prompt'],
    enhanced_prompt=item['enhanced_prompt']
).with_inputs('taste', 'user_input')
```

## DSPy Prediction Generation

The code uses DSPy to generate predictions:

```python
result = self.optimize(taste=taste, user_input=user_input)
```

## Summary

Yes, this code definitely uses DSPy to generate prompts. It leverages the DSPy framework with:

- Properly defined signatures
- Module-based architecture
- Language model integration
- Example-based training data

The only part that wasn't working was the `BootstrapFewShot` teleprompter, but the core DSPy functionality for prompt generation is fully implemented and working, as evidenced by the successful prompt generation outputs in the test runs.


# Answering Your Questions

## How many tastes are mentioned?

In this code, there are **6** artistic tastes mentioned:
- photorealistic
- oil painting
- anime
- cyberpunk
- watercolor
- 3d render

You can find this list in the `validate_taste()` function, which checks if a user-provided taste is valid.

## How to add a new taste?

If you want to add a new artistic style (like "sketch" or "pop art"), here's what you need to do:

1. **Update the valid tastes list** in the `validate_taste()` function:
   ```python
   valid_tastes = ['photorealistic', 'oil painting', 'anime', 'cyberpunk', 'watercolor', '3d render', 'NEW_TASTE']
   ```

2. **Add training data** for your new taste in the `create_training_data()` function. The code needs examples to learn how to optimize prompts for each style.

3. **Update the quality metric** in the `prompt_quality_metric()` function if your new taste has specific technical terms that should be included.

That's it! Just add your new taste to these places, and the system will be able to work with it. The code will then validate user inputs against the updated list of tastes and generate appropriate prompts for your new style.
