# 🏗️ Meta-Architecture Prompt Generator

**Transform vague project ideas into coherent, pattern-driven technical specifications using AI.**

A meta-prompt system that generates architectural frameworks (not rigid specs) for full-stack projects. It teaches AI to think in patterns, ensuring consistency across implementation phases while adapting to your specific domain.

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

**The Problem**: When using AI to build projects, you get:
- ❌ Inconsistent naming across features (`camelCase` → `snake_case`)
- ❌ Different patterns for similar operations (REST then GraphQL)
- ❌ Architecture drift as the conversation progresses
- ❌ Literal copying instead of contextual adaptation

**The Solution**: This system generates **immutable architectural patterns** that:
- ✅ Define the "rules of the game" once in Phase 1
- ✅ Force all subsequent features to follow those rules
- ✅ Adapt patterns to your specific domain (not literal templates)
- ✅ Include built-in validation to prevent pattern drift

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install requests
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Set your OpenRouter API key** (line 13):
```python
API_KEY = "your-actual-api-key-here"
```

2. **Define your project**:
```python
examples = [
    {
        "taste": "MVP coding - pattern-based architecture",
        "user_input": "a task management app with Next.js and Supabase, prefer short names, target small teams"
    }
]
```

3. **Run**:
```bash
python prompt_generator.py
```

4. **Get your architectural spec** with:
   - Pattern rules (not literal examples)
   - Decision frameworks
   - Implementation guidance
   - Built-in consistency validation

---

## 📋 How It Works

### Input
```python
{
    "taste": "MVP coding - pattern-based architecture",
    "user_input": "quiz app with Next.js, prefer descriptive names, targeting students"
}
```

### Output Structure
```
1. Project Understanding (the why)
2. Architecture Decisions (the stack)
3. 🔒 Foundational Pattern Anchors (Phase 1 - IMMUTABLE LAW)
   A. Database Schema Patterns
   B. API Endpoint Patterns
   C. Authentication Flow Pattern
   D. Data Access Layer Pattern
   E. Error Handling Pattern
   F. Frontend State/Component Patterns
4. MVP Feature Set (pattern applications)
5. Implementation Phases (with pattern validation)
6. MVP Scope Boundaries
7. Pattern Consistency Checklist
```

### The Magic: Pattern Application

**Traditional Approach**:
```
Output: "Create table quizResults with columns quizId, userId..."
Problem: AI copies literally, can't adapt to new features
```

**This System**:
```
Pattern Rule: "[feature][ActionPastTense] for completion tracking"
Reasoning: Past tense indicates completed actions
Implementation Guidance: Ask - What entity? What action?

For quiz feature: quiz + Results → quizResults ✓
For flashcard feature: flashcard + Reviews → flashcardReviews ✓
(Same pattern, different contextual application)
```

## 🎨 Use Cases

### 1. Full-Stack Web Apps
```python
{
    "taste": "MVP coding - pattern-based",
    "user_input": "social recipe sharing platform with React and Firebase, mobile-first design"
}
```
**Output**: Component patterns, Firebase data structure patterns, authentication flows

### 2. Data Warehouse Design
```python
{
    "taste": "BigQuery schema - architectural patterns only",
    "user_input": "e-commerce analytics warehouse, integrate with Shopify, target business analysts"
}
```
**Output**: Star schema patterns, SCD Type 2 patterns, partitioning strategies

### 3. API Design
```python
{
    "taste": "REST API architecture - pattern-driven",
    "user_input": "inventory management API with Node.js and PostgreSQL, B2B clients"
}
```
**Output**: Endpoint patterns, versioning strategy, error handling patterns

### 4. Mobile Apps
```python
{
    "taste": "React Native MVP - pattern-based",
    "user_input": "fitness tracking app with offline-first capability, sync with cloud"
}
```
**Output**: State management patterns, sync patterns, storage patterns

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Taste Parameter
Controls the output style and focus:

```python
# For web applications
"taste": "MVP coding - pattern-based architecture"

# For data engineering
"taste": "Data warehouse schema design - architectural patterns only"

# For API-first projects
"taste": "Backend architecture - pattern-driven, API-first design"

# For microservices
"taste": "Microservices architecture - service boundary patterns"
```

### User Input Structure

**Good User Input** (gives AI context to adapt patterns):
```python
"user_input": """
A project management tool for remote teams.
Tech stack: Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase, shadcn/ui.
Naming preference: Terse, industry-standard.
Users: Non-technical project managers.
Priority: Real-time collaboration over features.
"""
```

**Minimal User Input** (still works):
```python
"user_input": "todo app with React"
```

### API Configuration

```python
# Model selection (OpenRouter)
"model": "z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free"  # Fast, free tier

# Token limits
"max_tokens": 8000  # Increase for longer specs

# Timeout
timeout=60  # Seconds for API response
```

---

## 📊 Example Outputs

### Example 1: Quiz App

**Input**:
```python
taste: "MVP coding"
user_input: "simple quiz app using Next.js and Tailwind CSS"
```

**Output Highlights**:
```
Architecture: Next.js + API Routes + JSON files (MVP pragmatism)

Pattern Anchors:
- Table Naming: Plural camelCase → quizResults, quizQuestions
- API Structure: RESTful with { status, data, message }
- Auth Flow: Session-based UUID in HTTP-only cookie
- Error Handling: Standardized codes (NOT_FOUND, VALIDATION_ERROR)

Features:
1. Quiz Discovery (uses DB pattern + API pattern)
2. Quiz Taking (uses Auth pattern + State pattern)
3. Results Display (uses Data Access pattern)

All features reference Phase 1 patterns explicitly.
```

---

## 🛡️ The Grounding System

### Core Principle: Immutable Patterns

**Phase 1** establishes the "laws":
```
Database Pattern: [entity]Results for tracking completions
API Pattern: POST /api/[resource] for creation
Auth Pattern: Session UUID in cookie
```

**Phase 2+** applies the laws:
```
Feature: Flashcard System
🔒 Database: Uses [entity]Results pattern → flashcardReviews
🔒 API: Uses POST /api/[resource] → POST /api/flashcard-reviews
🔒 Auth: Uses session UUID validation from Phase 1
```

### Built-in Validation

Every phase includes:
```
PATTERN CHECK: Uses [Pattern A, B, C] applied to [domain context]
VALIDATION: Confirm zero new patterns, only new applications
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific About Preferences
```python
# ❌ Vague
"user_input": "build an app"

# ✅ Specific
"user_input": "build a habit tracker for iOS users, prefer minimalist UI, offline-first"
```

### 2. Include Technical Constraints
```python
"user_input": """
E-commerce platform.
Must integrate with: Stripe, SendGrid, existing PostgreSQL DB.
Team skill level: Junior developers.
"""
```

### 3. Define Your Audience
```python
"user_input": "Admin dashboard for non-technical restaurant owners (not developers)"
# → AI will choose verbose naming, simpler patterns
```

### 4. Specify Trade-offs
```python
"user_input": "Social media feed. Prioritize: speed over features, mobile over desktop"
# → AI will optimize patterns for performance
```

---

## 🔍 Understanding the Output

### Pattern Rules vs Examples

**Pattern Rule** (what you follow):
```
Table Naming Pattern: [feature][ActionPastTense]
```

**Example Format** (how it looks):
```
quizResults, flashcardReviews, lessonCompletions
```

**Implementation Guidance** (how to apply):
```
Ask: What's the entity? What action?
Combine using the pattern.
```

### When Implementing

**Don't do this**:
```javascript
// ❌ Literal copying
const table = "quizResults" // from example
```

**Do this**:
```javascript
// ✅ Pattern application
const entity = "flashcard"
const action = "Review"
const table = `${entity}${action}s` // flashcardReviews
// Follows the [entity][ActionPastTense] pattern
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Output is Truncated
```python
# Increase token limit
"max_tokens": 8000  # or higher
```

### AI Creates Literal Names Despite Pattern Instructions
```python
# Add to user_input:
"user_input": "... (use patterns, not literal examples from the spec)"
```

### Too Generic/Not Domain-Specific
```python
# Add more context to user_input:
"user_input": """
[Your project]
Target users: [specific audience]
Key differentiator: [what makes this unique]
Technical constraints: [any limitations]
"""
```

### API Timeout
```python
# Simplify the prompt or increase timeout
timeout=120  # 2 minutes
```

---

## 📈 Advanced Usage

### Chaining Specs

1. **Generate architecture spec** (this tool)
2. **Feed to implementation AI**:
```
"Use this architectural spec as your guide. 
Implement Feature 1 following all Phase 1 patterns.
Cite which pattern you're using for each decision."
```

### Multi-Phase Projects

```python
# Phase 1: Generate initial spec
result1 = generate_prompt("MVP coding", "core features")

# Phase 2: Extend the architecture
result2 = generate_prompt(
    "MVP coding - extend existing patterns",
    f"Add admin panel to this system: {result1}"
)
```

### Team Alignment

1. Generate spec once
2. Share with team
3. Everyone implements using same patterns
4. Code reviews check pattern adherence

---

## 🎓 Why This Approach?

### Traditional AI Coding
```
User: "Add user profiles"
AI: *creates new patterns, uses different naming, introduces inconsistency*
Problem: No memory of architectural decisions
```

### With Meta-Architecture
```
User: "Add user profiles"
AI reads Phase 1: "Must use [entity]Data pattern, camelCase naming"
AI: "Creating userData table following Phase 1 pattern..."
Solution: Patterns are explicit and checkable
```

### The Philosophy

> **"Define the rules of the game, not the specific moves."**

- ✅ Rules are transferable across projects
- ✅ Moves adapt to specific context
- ✅ Consistency without rigidity
- ✅ AI becomes an architect, not just a coder
